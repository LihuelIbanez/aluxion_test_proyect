# aluxion_test_proyect

A new Flutter project.

It was a fun proyect!

I use GETX for state managment, also I try to implement a little bit of clean arquitecture.

In the Folder, CORE, there is all the principal configurations for the core of the proyect, so the proyect can evolve in the future. The Second folder it's GALLERY, in there you will find all the build for the proyect.

There are 4 screens, and in ROUTES you will find the managment for the navigation:
    1.Splash Screen.
    2.Gallery Screen.
    3.BigPicture Screen.
    4.AuthorReference Screen.
 
3 of the 4 screens has there own controller.
 
 Also, you can find all the personalize Widgets, in the folder WIDGET.
 
 I try to impliment the clean chain of data, but that specifict feture it will come in the future when i have more time.

ENTITIES ===>> MODELS ===>> USECASES ===>> REPOSITORY ===>> REPOSITORY IMPL ===>> USECASE ===>> FACTORY ===>> FINAL DATA

Next Update:
  ===>> Implente a good Dio lens, for visializaton of the variables and request.
  ===>> Error Managment.
  ===>> Add new fetures about Search and personalization of the galery.
  ===>> Regionalization
  ===>> Http Client for more personalization calls to the server.
  ===>> Unit Testing

  HAVE FUN !
